### Briefly About Myself:

After graduating from the Moscow Power Engineering Institute, I worked as an energy engineer in food production factory for about 2.5 years and for another 6 years after that as a leading energy engineer in public catering and retail.<br>

In recent years, I have been thinking about changing my profession. While working, I started studying frontend development in courses.
I got basic knowledge of HTML layout, CSS, JavaScript basics, and started learning ReactJS. I was impressed by the thoughtfulness of the language, as well as by those who create and develop it all - the сommunity of programmers. I realized that I like it and I want to be a part of it and work as a a Software Developer.
However, the work took too much time, which was not enough for a full-fledged study of frontend development, I had to put my studies on pause.<br>

And in February 2023, I decided not to renew my employment contract as an energy engineer, quit and began studying frontend development at The Rolling Scopes School course.
So now I'm starting to fully devote myself to studying and believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Software Developer on interesting and useful projects.
<br>

So now my motto is:
> _Not a step back and not a day without a line of code!_<br>
